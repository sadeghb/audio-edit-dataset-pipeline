def load_silero_model():
    """
    Loads the pre-trained Silero VAD model and its utility functions from Torch Hub.

    This function is called once at the module level to ensure the model is
    loaded into memory only a single time when the application starts. This
    singleton-like pattern is efficient and prevents slow model loading during
    request processing.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the loaded model and a dictionary of utility functions.
    
    Raises:
        Exception: If the model cannot be downloaded or loaded from Torch Hub.
